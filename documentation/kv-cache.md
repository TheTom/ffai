# KV Cache

The KV cache holds per-layer K and V tensors so subsequent decode
steps don't re-compute attention over the entire prefix. FFAI ships
one cache implementation today (raw fp16 / bf16); compressed variants
land in Phase 5.

## What's supported today

| Algorithm | When to use | Memory ratio | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Raw fp16 / bf16** (`KVCache`, default) | All current models. | 1× | ✅ Shipped (Phase 2). |
| **Affine quantization int8** (`AffineQuantizedKVCache`) | Memory-constrained; ~7% decode-tok/s tax. | ~0.55× (45% smaller) measured on Qwen3 1.7B | ✅ Shipped (Phase 5c — int8 only; int4 + int6 are follow-ups). |
| **TurboQuant** | Best memory ratio at minimal quality loss. | ~6–8× at `turbo4v2` | ⏳ Planned (Phase 5d). |
| **SSM / Hybrid** | Mamba / GatedDeltaNet (Qwen 3.5, NemotronH) | n/a — stores recurrent + conv state | ⏳ Planned (Phase 5e). |
| **Batched** | Multi-stream decode (speculative, B>1 serving) | linear in B | ⏳ Planned (Phase 8+). |

The shipped raw cache is what every demo / test exercises today.
Compressed variants are deliberately deferred — the goal of Phase 4
(perf) was to nail the dispatch path; the goal of Phase 5 is to add
cache compression on top.

## How the cache works

Each layer holds its own `KVCache` instance. During the forward pass:

1. `Q`, `K`, `V` are projected from the post-RMSNorm hidden state.
2. RoPE is applied to `Q` and `K`.
3. **`kv_cache_update`** kernel appends the new `K`/`V` rows into the
   per-layer cache buffer **on the GPU**. No CPU↔GPU sync — the
   append enqueues onto the same `MTLCommandBuffer` as the rest of
   the layer.
4. `sdpa_decode` kernel scores the single query row against the full
   cached `K`/`V` slice up to the current position.

The cache buffer is allocated once per layer at the configured max
context length; appends bump an `offset` rather than reallocating.
This is the same shape MLX uses, minus the Metal compile latency.

```swift
let caches = model.engine.makeKVCache()  // [KVCache], one per layer
```

`makeKVCache()` is on the `LanguageModel` protocol — `LlamaModel` and
`Qwen3Model` both implement it. The user owns the cache lifetime;
keep it across `forward(...)` / `forwardSample(...)` calls for
multi-turn or streaming.

## Choosing a configuration

Two schemes ship today, selectable via `LoadOptions.kvCache`:

```swift
public enum KVCacheKind: Sendable, Equatable {
    case raw                                                // default
    case affineQuantized(bits: Int = 8, groupSize: Int = 64) // Phase 5c
    // .turbo  — Phase 5d
}
```

Activating the int8 affine cache:

```swift
let model = try await Model.load(
    "mlx-community/Qwen3-1.7B-4bit",
    options: LoadOptions(kvCache: .affineQuantized(bits: 8, groupSize: 64))
)
```

Or via the CLI:

```bash
ffai --model mlx-community/Qwen3-1.7B-4bit --prompt "..." --kv-cache int8
```

### How `AffineQuantizedKVCache` works

Per attention layer the cache holds three packed buffers per K (and
V): `kWeights` (u32, 4 int8 values per word), `kScales` (fp16/bf16,
per-group), `kBiases` (fp16/bf16, per-group). All layers in one
`makeKVCache(...)` call share **one** pair of working buffers
sized `[nKVHeads, maxSeq, headDim]` in the model dtype. On
`appendOnGPU(...)` the `quantize_kv_int8` kernel writes the new
row into the layer's compressed storage. On `prepareForAttention(...)`
(called before SDPA) the `bulk_dequant_kv_int8` kernel materialises
the live slice into the shared working buffer, which SDPA then
reads. Metal's default hazard tracking serializes the working-buffer
reuse across layers within a single command buffer.

### Measured on Qwen3 1.7B 4-bit at maxSeq=40960

|  | Raw | int8 affine | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| KV cache (alloc) | 4.38 GB | 2.32 GB | −47% |
| Peak GPU | 5.28 GB | 3.38 GB | −36% |
| Decode tok/s | 46.7 | 43.6 | −7% |
| Greedy output | "...Paris...Washington, D.C. So, the capital of the United Kingdom is" | "...Paris...Washington, D.C. The capital of the United Kingdom is London," | matches first ~13 tokens, then minor drift |

### Coming next (5c follow-ups)

- **int4 + int6 variants** — same kernel shape, byte-packed
  storage (mirror the existing dequant_gather_int{3,5,6} pattern).
  int4 should land ~3.5× memory savings vs raw.
- **Fused dequant-into-SDPA** — today each attention step pays
  one extra dequant kernel dispatch. A fused
  `bulk_dequant + sdpa_decode` kernel removes the working-buffer
  materialisation entirely.

## Multi-turn / streaming

For multi-turn or streaming UIs, drive the loop yourself and reuse
the cache across calls (see [quickstart.md § Lower-level
API](quickstart.md#lower-level-api)):

```swift
let caches = model.engine.makeKVCache()

func respond(_ prompt: String, position: inout Int) -> String {
    var pos = position
    var nextToken = 0
    for t in model.tokenizer.encode(text: prompt) {
        nextToken = model.engine.forwardSample(tokenId: t, position: pos, caches: caches)
        pos += 1
    }
    var generated: [Int] = []
    while !isStop(nextToken) {
        generated.append(nextToken)
        nextToken = model.engine.forwardSample(tokenId: nextToken, position: pos, caches: caches)
        pos += 1
    }
    position = pos
    return model.tokenizer.decode(tokens: generated)
}
```

`pos` keeps advancing across calls; the cache holds every K / V row
appended so far.

## What's coming (Phase 5+)

From [`planning/plan.md`](../planning/plan.md):

- **Affine quantized KV cache** — 4 / 6 / 8-bit affine group-quant
  for K and V. Self-transitions raw → quantized at `startOffset` so
  prefill stays fast. ~3.5× memory at 4-bit; modest decode-tok/s tax.
- **TurboQuant cache** — block-wise MSE codec with asymmetric K/V
  bits (e.g. 4-bit K, 2-bit V — `turbo4v2`). Two attention paths:
  TurboFlash compressed-domain Metal kernel (default) or
  bulk-dequant → MLXFast SDPA (opt-in). ~6-8× memory.
- **`SSMStateCache`** — for Mamba / GatedDeltaNet families
  (Qwen 3.5 / NemotronH / Jamba). Stores conv + recurrent state
  instead of K/V; composes with attention layers via `CacheList`.
- **Batched cache** — slot-based admission for fixed-size batches;
  enables speculative decoding and multi-stream serving.

Each lands in its own commit with the corresponding kernels in
`metaltile`. Affine and TurboQuant are the highest-priority Phase 5
deliverables; SSM/GDN follow.
